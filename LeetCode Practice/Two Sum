# Merge Strings Alternitavely Algorithm

## You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. Return the merged string.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1, word2):
        """
        :type word1: str
        :type word2: str
        :rtype: str
        """
    mergedString = ''
    i, j = 0, 0
